1. First, you need a compiled version of PennMUSH. Fate.exe was written on PennMUSH version 1.8.6 patchlevel 0, retrieved 2 December 2015. You can get the raw PennMUSH files from https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush, and the installation guide is at https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush/wiki/Installing-PennMUSH-on-Windows.

2. Start and sign onto the server, using #1.
2a. Create the +Fate and +Stress channels ('@chan/add +Fate' and '@chan/add +Stress').
2b. Create the objects in GitHub's Objects/Master folder. Make sure to set all DB_* attributes correctly. Move those objects into the Master Room (usually room #2).
2c. Create the objects in GitHub's Objects/Upstream, and place them somewhere secure (not necessarily the Master Room).
2d. Create the Player Ancestor, using guidelines in GitHub's Objects/Player Ancestor folder.

3. From your MUSH folder, edit game/mush.cnf as follows.
3a. null_eq_zero yes
3b. tiny_math yes
3c. ancestor_player ## (where ## is the DBref of the Player Ancestor created in step 2d).

4. @restart the server. The Player Ancestor will now be active, and you'll be able to use the global functions on the Global Function Object.

5. If necessary, further customise the Player Ancestor (for player character traits) and Chargen Object (for stunts, especially).

6. Create Chargen Rooms, @set Wizard and @parented to the Chargen Object.

7. Populate your MUSH's help files from GitHub's +Help.txt.
