# Fate.exe
Fate is a roleplaying game system published by Evil Hat Productions. The most recent versions are Fate Core and the Fate Accelerated Edition, and it's been licensed for use by systems like The Dresden Files RPG, Atomic Robo RPG, and many more.

This project, Fate.exe, is a PennMUSH code base (developed on version 1.8.6 patchlevel 0, rev 6987996) for the creation of MUSHes using the Fate systems. It's intended to be as flexible as the RPG system itself, with attributes adjustable to create different kinds of Fate systems and Fate characters.

To start making your Fate-based game, follow the instructions in Setup.txt.
