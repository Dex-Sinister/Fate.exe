------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+roll[/q] [<Skill>] [<modifiers>] [=<player1 player2 player3>] [(<comments>)]

Rolls the dice. <Skill> is the name of a skill (with partial matching); <modifiers> is a string of positive or negative numbers; players can be given, to show the roll privately only to those players; <comments> can be added to display more about what the roll is for. If /q is given, then it's a quick roll. Otherwise, it saves the roll so it can be modified with invokes.

+roll/clear: Quietly clears a saved roll.
+roll/invoke/<bonus|reroll>[/<player>] [<justification>]: Spends one of your own fate points, and invokes an aspect for a reroll or bonus. If <player> is given, that player gets the spent fate point (or it goes into their NPC pool, if /NPC is also given). If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/compel/<penalty|reroll> [<justification>]: Gains a fate point, and compels an aspect for a reroll or penalty. If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/tag/<bonus|penalty|reroll> [<justification>]: Without spending any fate points, invokes or compels an aspect for a reroll, bonus, or penalty. If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/npc/invoke/<bonus|reroll>[/<player>[/NPC]] [<justification>]: Spends one of your NPC FP, and invokes an aspect for a reroll or bonus. If <player> is given, that player gets the spent fate point (or it goes into their NPC pool, if /NPC is also given). If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/npc/compel/<penalty|reroll> [<justification>]: Gains an NPC FP, and compels an aspect for a reroll or penalty. If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/mod <shifts>[=<justification>]: Modifies your roll by the given number of shifts. Useful for if you forget a situational bonus.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
& +stress

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+stress/damage [<track>=]<box>: Fills in one of your stress boxes. If you don't provide <track>, it assumes the first in your list.

+stress/con/set [<track>/]<consequence>=<name>: Fills that consequence slot, if it isn't already full. If <track> isn't given, assumes the first track in your list.

Note: In place of <consequence>, use '<consequence level>' (if a general-use consequence) or '<track>/<num>' (if a bonus consequence). For example, '+stress/con/forceclear Moderate' or '+stress/con/forceclear Mental/1'. If a bonus consequence, you can write nothing before the slash, to assume your first stress track. For example, '+stress/con/recover /1'.

+stress/con/forceclear <consequence>=<justification>: Immediately clears that consequence slot.
+stress/con/recover <consequence>=<justification>: Sets that consequence into recovery, and saves the time the recovery began.

On Fate Hub, player characters follow different 'rulesets'. These rulesets specify information about how the code should handle their sheets: it says what skills are in their list, how many stress tracks they have, how many free stunts they're allowed, and more. All the given rules for a ruleset are stored on a 'ruleset object'. For example, there is a ruleset object for the default Fate Core dials.

Players can create 'homebrew ruleset objects', or just 'homebrew objects', to create their own rulesets. With these homebrew objects, you can tweak many of Fate's dials, to settings that better suit your group and campaign. Then, you can point your fellow players at that object, and voila - the chargen and dice code handle them using your ruleset.

Creating and filling in a homebrew object takes some steps.

1. Create the object.
If you want to start with a blank slate, you use '+homebrew/create <name>'. For example, Lister  wants to start from the ground up when making his Red Dwarf version of Fate; he types '+homebrew/create Red Dwarf'.

If you want to springboard off from existing rules, you use '+homebrew/copy <original>/<name>'. For example, Barry wants to start from the Fate Accelerated Edition rules when making his Central City ruleset; he types '+homebrew/copy Fate Accelerated Edition=Central City'.

2. Check the attributes.
Ruleset objects work by a set of attributes, which tell the code how to handle certain parts of the system. You can see these attributes with '+ruleset/homebrew <object>'. For example, Barry wants to see how his object's attributes are laid out; he types '+ruleset/homebrew Central City'.

He can then read through the list, and see a brief explanation of what each one means. He sees that Skills/Cap has a value of 4, which means that players' skills are capped at Great (+4); and he sees that Skills/Points has a value of 20, which means that players start with 20 skill points. Hm, that may be a bit low for a superhero setting.

3. Set the attributes.
You can use the +homebrew commands to change the object's attributes - in particular, +homebrew/set. The format for this is '+homebrew/set <object>><section>/<attribute>=<value>'. An example should make this clearer.

Barry thinks that a game of superheroes should have a higher skill cap. Honestly, who would give The Flash an Athletics skill below Superb (+5)? So, he changes the skill cap /to/ Superb (+5), by typing '+homebrew/set Central City>Skills/Cap=5'.

He also thinks that everyone should be able to take a bit of a beating, even if their minds can still be hurt. He wants everyone to start off with 2 more Physical stress boxes than normal. He types '+homebrew/set Central City>Track/Bonus=Physical/2'.

There could be plenty of other changes he wants to make: changing skill names, altering conseqence levels, and so on. Once he's done with all his adjustments, he's ready for step 4.

4. Choose the ruleset.
Once the ruleset's ready, you can choose it as the ruleset for your character. Doing so will wipe your current character sheet, so you may want to make a backup first. You do this with '+backup <name>'. Barry calls his backup 'Mild-Mannered CSI', and so he types '+backup Mild-Mannered CSI'.

Now, you're ready to change rulesets. To choose a homebrew object, you use '+ruleset/choose Homebrew=<object>'. If the object is in your inventory or in the room with you, you can call it by name; otherwise, you'll have to use its number. Barry types '+ruleset/choose Homebrew=Central City'.

Once one player has chosen the ruleset, other players can choose the same ruleset by targeting the player instead of the object. Barry's friends Cisco and Caitlin type '+ruleset/choose Player=Barry'.

Now, they're all ready to start saving Central City!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
& +backup
& backup
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+backup <name>: Backs up your current character sheet to reload later, including its ruleset and a name you can use to remember it.
+backups: Lists your backups by number, name, and ruleset.
+backup/load <number>: Loads that backup. This will wipe your current sheet; you may want to use +backup for it first.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
& +milestone
& milestone
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+milestone/<type> <player>: Gives that player a milestone. You can use 'me' to target yourself. Type may be 'significant' (granting a skill point), 'major' (granting both a skill point and a refresh point), 'refresh' (granting only a refresh point), or 'cap' (raising the player's skill cap). This command autocompletes, so you can give Jim a major milestone just with '+milestone/m Jim'.
