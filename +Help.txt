------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+roll[/q] [<Skill>] [<modifiers>] [=<player1 player2 player3>] [(<comments>)]

Rolls the dice. <Skill> is the name of a skill (with partial matching); <modifiers> is a string of positive or negative numbers; players can be given, to show the roll privately only to those players; <comments> can be added to display more about what the roll is for. If /q is given, then it's a quick roll. Otherwise, it saves the roll so it can be modified with invokes.

+roll/clear: Quietly clears a saved roll.
+roll/invoke/<bonus|reroll>[/<player>] [<justification>]: Spends one of your own fate points, and invokes an aspect for a reroll or bonus. If <player> is given, that player gets the spent fate point (or it goes into their NPC pool, if /NPC is also given). If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/compel/<penalty|reroll> [<justification>]: Gains a fate point, and compels an aspect for a reroll or penalty. If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/tag/<bonus|penalty|reroll> [<justification>]: Without spending any fate points, invokes or compels an aspect for a reroll, bonus, or penalty. If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/npc/invoke/<bonus|reroll>[/<player>[/NPC]] [<justification>]: Spends one of your NPC FP, and invokes an aspect for a reroll or bonus. If <player> is given, that player gets the spent fate point (or it goes into their NPC pool, if /NPC is also given). If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.
+roll/npc/compel/<penalty|reroll> [<justification>]: Gains an NPC FP, and compels an aspect for a reroll or penalty. If <justification> is given, that's broadcast to the +Fate channel as well as those who can see the roll.

& +stress
& stress
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+stress/damage [<track>=]<box>: Fills in one of your stress boxes. If you don't provide <track>, it assumes the first in your list.
+stress/damage/catch [<track>=]<box>: Fills in one of your stress boxes, ignoring special 'Toughness' boxes (a la The Dresden Files RPG). If you don't provide <track>, it assumes the first in your list.
+stress/clear: Clears all stress from all your tracks.
+stress/con/set [<track>/]<consequence>=<name>: Fills that consequence slot, if it isn't already full. If <track> isn't given, assumes the first track in your list.

Note: In place of <consequence>, use '<consequence level>' (if a general-use consequence) or '<track>/<num>' (if a bonus consequence). For example, '+stress/con/forceclear Moderate' or '+stress/con/forceclear Mental/1'. If a bonus consequence, you can write nothing before the slash, to assume your first stress track. For example, '+stress/con/recover /1'.

+stress/con/forceclear <consequence>=<justification>: Immediately clears that consequence slot.
+stress/con/recover <consequence>=<justification>: Sets that consequence into recovery, and saves the time the recovery began.
+stress/con/unrecover <consequence>: Takes that consequence out of recovery.
